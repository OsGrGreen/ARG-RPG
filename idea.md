# Idea

## General

A webbrowser based game where the players are control of the story, and their collective actions shape the narrative. 

Each player gets assigned a person living in this world, can be of different status, age and occupation. The character can lose their life, and then the player will start again with a new character.

Depending on your player you can do different actions.

Then I think the players should solve some collective mystery in the world, but I am not sure. 

## To be determined

### Player agency:

- Do people only get a blank screen with choices?
- Do they control an avatar?
- Can they walk around?
- interact?
